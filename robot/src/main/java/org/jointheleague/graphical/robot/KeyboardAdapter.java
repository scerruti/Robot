/**
 * <p>
 * This class is used to control a org.jointheleague.graphical.robot through key presses. The up, down,
 * left, and right arrow keys are used to make the org.jointheleague.graphical.robot advance, go backwards,
 * turn left, and turn right respectively. The {@link KeyEvent}s that are used
 * to control the Robot and the ways that those KeyEvents control the Robot can
 * be changed by extending this class and overriding the
 * {@link #keyPressed(KeyEvent)}, {@link #keyReleased(KeyEvent)}, and
 * {@link #keyTyped(KeyEvent)} methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to add multiple KeyboardAdapters each controlling a different
 * Robot. To be able to distinguish which {@link KeyEvent}s control which
 * Robots, the set of KeyEvents that each KeyboardAdapter reacts to should be
 * distinct. For example, one KeyboardAdapter could react only to KeyEvents
 * where the Shift key is not depressed, and another could react only to events
 * where the Shift key is depressed. It is, nevertheless, also possible to have
 * all KeyboardAdapters react to a same KeyEvent. For example, when the user
 * types 'm', each KeyboardAdapter could react by miniaturizing the Robot that
 * it controls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A KeyboardAdapter controls the Robot from its own thread. It is not possible
 * to have more than one KeyboardAdapter controlling the <em>same</em> Robot.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example of how to use:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
 * {
 * 	Robot rob = new Robot();
 * 	Robot.addKeyboardAdapter(new KeyboardAdapter(rob));
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
